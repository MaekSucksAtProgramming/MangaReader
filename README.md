Functional specification   

Normally a functional specification should contain (at the very least) a series of screen and beneath those screens a list of the functionality included on that page.     
Iâ€™ll make those in a bit. 

Step 1

* Users should be able to select a folder and open the images in the reader
* Users should be able to move between the opened images
* * By clicking on the page
* * By clicking on the arrows at the edges of the window
* * By using the keyboard arrow keys
